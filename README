Instructions
Write a Python class named Point3D defined by x, y, and z. Define a method that returns (x, y ,z). This tells Python to represent this object in the following format: (x, y, z). Then create a variable named my_point containing a new instance of Point3D with x=1, y=2, and z=3 and print it.
Write a Python class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width. Define two methods, area and perimeter, which will compute the area and the perimeter of the rectangle. Then create a variable named my_rectangle containing a new instance of Rectangle with width=3 and length = 4 and compute both area and perimeter ( the area is expected to be 3*4=12 and perimeter 2*(3+4)=14).
Write a Python  class named Circle constructed by its center O and radius r. Define two methods, area and perimeter, which will compute the area and the perimeter of the circle, and is Inside() method which allows you to test whether a point A(x, y) belongs to the circle C(O, r) or not.
Suppose we want to model a bank account with support for deposit and withdraw operations. Letâ€™s create a Python class named Bank defined by its balance. Define two methods, deposit and withdraw, to compute the new amount of each operation.
